Is a project that transforms <b>Doxygen</b> XML output into a Markdown based format. 
A major goal is to use it to embed it into browsable README's on GitHub.
<br/><br/>
The embedded content would serve the same purpose as a static HTML site.
Except that it would be more integrated into the online source code browser.
