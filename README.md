# MdDox

Is a project that transforms Doxygen XML output into a GFM based 
HTML format. 

The primary goal is to embed it into markdown on GitHub. 
The embedded content would serve the same purpose as a static HTML site. 
Except that it would be more integrated into the online source code browser. Another goal is to build 
dot graphs from the source code comments. 

## Current State

It is still in active development. In its current state, it can embed into GitHub,
and it can generate graphs. There are still a lot of loose ends that need worked 
out. It needs tested on different repositories. 
(repositories that already use Doxygen as its primary engine)

 
## Documentation index

The output for this repository can be found in the [Current](Current/) directory.
