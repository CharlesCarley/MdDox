# MdDox

Is a project that transforms [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html) XML output into a GFM based 
HTML format. A major goal is to use it to embed it into browsable README's on GitHub. The embedded
content would serve the same purpose as a static HTML site. Except that it would be more
integrated into the online source code browser. Another goal is to allow drawing graphs with
[dot](https://www.graphviz.org/) so that concepts can be built quickly and automaticlly from
the source code comments rather than having to switch to an external editor then link it to a
README.

## Current State

It is still in active development. It can embed into GitHub, and it can automatically generate
graphs. But is there still a lot of loose ends that need to be worked out.


## Documentation index

The MdDox output for this repository can be found
in the [Current](Current/) directory.
