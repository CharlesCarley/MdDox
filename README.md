# MdDox

Is a project that transforms Doxygen XML output into a GFM based 
HTML format. 

The primary goal is to embed it into markdown on GitHub. 
The embedded content would serve the same purpose as a static HTML site. 
Except that it would be more integrated into the online source code browser. Another goal is to build 
dot graphs from the source code comments. 

## Current State
It is still in active development, but it can embed into GitHub, and it can generate graphs. But there  are  still a lot of loose ends that needs worked out. It needs tested on different repositories. (Preferably on repositories that already use Doxygen as its primary engine)
